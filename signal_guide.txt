	HOW TO PREPARE SIGNAL

basically that is a strange model I developed

signal is split into 4 'modules' with 0-2 modifyers

1st module can either be: ['communication', 'power', 'temperature', 'shutdown']
2nd one: ['server', 'rack', 'lab']
3rd: ['restored', 'partial_loss', 'lost', 'status', 'shutdown', 'init', 'completed']
4th: ['UPS', 'grid', 'raised', 'dropped']

modifyers:
1st one represents: ['rack_id', 'server', 'value of temperature', 'timeout']
2nd one: ['datetime', 'value of temperature']

Now depending on purpose, signal is just a string/array with a combination of these modules.

	EXAMPLE

We want to send a notification, saying that temperature in rack reached certain value. So we need to send a signal.
	
		temperature rack status raised 1 60

	now this says that temperature in rack no. 1 reached 60C degrees
	and the notification "Inlet temperature in rack 1 reached 60C" will be sent

		power server partial_loss pl-byd-esxi12

	this one means that there was a partial power loss in a pl-byd-esxi12 server
	notification: "Partial power loss in server pl-byd-esxi12. Suspected PDU failure."

I don't really think it's the most optimized way to handle signals, but I guess that's useful
